Goal of my fork is to get sideband data from received FM and DAB
transmissions, like the raw RDS data groups so that a host software can
decode them, e.g. to extract TMC (Traffic Message Channel) information using
applications like Redsea:

Ultimate goal is to extract DAB TPEG channel data, which the SI468x should
be capable off - though it's poorly documented.

# DAB Shield
Welcome to the DAB Shield Library GIT.
DAB Shield is a Library for the Control of the DAB/DAB+/FM DAB Shield.

The DAB Shield provides high quality DAB/DAB+ and FM decoding along with Service Information (DAB/DAB+) and RDS (FM) to provide station data.  The Board includes Analog Audio Output (3.5mm Stereo Jack) and Digital Audio IIS audio output.  

The DAB Shield is compatible with both +5v and +3.3v arduino boards including UNO, DUE, M0, ZERO as well as STM32, NXP LPC, ESP32 boards.
## Board PIN usage
The Circuit Pin usage is detailed here: [https://www.dabshield.com/circuit](https://www.dabshield.com/circuit)

The DAB Shield is supplied with a small Antenna and is powered from the Arduino Board so no external power supply is required.

## How to install
Open library manager in Arduino IDE, search for and install the DABShield library.
## API
The API is documented here: [https://www.dabshield.com/library/api-page](https://www.dabshield.com/library/api-page)
## HELP
Forum and example code is available at www.dabshield.com
